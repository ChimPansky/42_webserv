# HTTP Requests and Responses

## Introduction

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines the structure of requests and responses between clients (usually web browsers) and servers.

## HTTP Requests

### What is an HTTP Request?

An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to a server, asking for a specific resource or action. The request contains:

1. **Request Line**: Indicates the HTTP method, the resource URL, and the HTTP version.
2. **Headers**: Provide additional information about the request.
3. **Body (Optional)**: Contains data sent to the server (e.g., form data, JSON).

### Syntax of an HTTP Request

```
<HTTP-Method> <Request-URI> <HTTP-Version>
<Header-Name>: <Header-Value>
<Header-Name>: <Header-Value>

<Body>
```

### Example of an HTTP GET Request

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html
```

### Example of an HTTP POST Request

```http
POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 27

name=John&age=30
```

## HTTP Responses

### What is an HTTP Response?

An HTTP response is a message sent by the server back to the client, containing the requested resource or the status of the request. The response contains:

1. **Status Line**: Indicates the HTTP version, the status code, and a reason phrase.
2. **Headers**: Provide additional information about the response.
3. **Body (Optional)**: Contains the data returned by the server (e.g., HTML content, JSON).

### Syntax of an HTTP Response

```
<HTTP-Version> <Status-Code> <Reason-Phrase>
<Header-Name>: <Header-Value>
<Header-Name>: <Header-Value>

<Body>
```

### Example of an HTTP 200 OK Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 137

<html>
<head><title>Example</title></head>
<body><h1>Hello, world!</h1></body>
</html>
```

### Example of an HTTP 404 Not Found Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 24

<html><body>Not Found</body></html>
```

## Common HTTP Methods

1. **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
2. **POST**: Send data to the server to create or update a resource.
3. **PUT**: Update or create a resource.
4. **DELETE**: Remove a resource.
5. **HEAD**: Retrieve the headers of a resource.
6. **OPTIONS**: Query the server for supported methods.
7. **PATCH**: Apply partial modifications to a resource.
8. **TRACE**: Echoes the received request.
9. **CONNECT**: Establish a network connection to a server.

## Common HTTP Status Codes

1. **200 OK**: The request was successful.
2. **201 Created**: A resource was successfully created.
3. **204 No Content**: The request was successful but there is no content to send back.
4. **301 Moved Permanently**: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
5. **302 Found**: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
6. **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or cannot be understood by the server.
7. **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required and has failed or not been provided.
8. **403 Forbidden**: The request was valid, but the server is refusing to respond to it.
9. **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
10. **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition.
11. **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unavailable (overloaded or down).

## Conclusion

HTTP is a fundamental protocol for the web, allowing clients and servers to communicate. Understanding HTTP requests and responses is essential for web development and debugging.
