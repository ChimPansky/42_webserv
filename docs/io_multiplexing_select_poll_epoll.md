# I/O Multiplexing: select, poll, and epoll

In network programming and other I/O-intensive applications, it's often necessary to manage multiple file descriptors, such as sockets, simultaneously. `select`, `poll`, and `epoll` are system calls in Unix-like operating systems (like Linux) that allow you to monitor multiple file descriptors to see if they are ready for an I/O operation (read, write, etc.).

## 1. select
`select` is the oldest mechanism for I/O multiplexing. It allows a program to monitor multiple file descriptors to see if any are ready for I/O operations.

### Basic Usage Example
```c
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
    fd_set readfds;
    struct timeval tv;
    int retval, fd;

    fd = open("/dev/random", O_RDONLY);

    FD_ZERO(&readfds);
    FD_SET(fd, &readfds);

    tv.tv_sec = 5;
    tv.tv_usec = 0;

    retval = select(fd + 1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, &tv);

    if (retval == -1) {
        perror("select()");
    } else if (retval) {
        printf("Data is available now.
");
    } else {
        printf("No data within five seconds.
");
    }
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

### Limitations
- Fixed maximum number of file descriptors (`FD_SETSIZE`, typically 1024).
- Inefficient for large sets of file descriptors.
- Requires reinitialization of the file descriptor set before each call.

## 2. poll
`poll` is similar to `select` but offers more flexibility and scalability. Instead of using fixed-size sets, `poll` uses an array of `pollfd` structures.

### Basic Usage Example
```c
#include <poll.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
    struct pollfd fds[1];
    int timeout_msecs = 5000;
    int ret;

    fds[0].fd = open("/dev/random", O_RDONLY);
    fds[0].events = POLLIN;

    ret = poll(fds, 1, timeout_msecs);

    if (ret == -1) {
        perror("poll()");
    } else if (ret == 0) {
        printf("Timeout occurred! No data within five seconds.
");
    } else {
        if (fds[0].revents & POLLIN) {
            printf("Data is available now.
");
        }
    }
    close(fds[0].fd);
    return 0;
}
```

### Advantages over `select`
- No fixed limit on the number of file descriptors.
- Easier to manage large sets of file descriptors.

## 3. epoll
`epoll` is a more efficient alternative to `select` and `poll`, designed specifically for Linux. It is particularly well-suited for applications that need to handle a large number of file descriptors.

### Basic Usage Example
```c
#include <sys/epoll.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int epfd, nfds, fd;
    struct epoll_event ev, events[1];

    epfd = epoll_create1(0);
    fd = open("/dev/random", O_RDONLY);

    ev.events = EPOLLIN;
    ev.data.fd = fd;
    epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, fd, &ev);

    nfds = epoll_wait(epfd, events, 1, 5000);

    if (nfds == -1) {
        perror("epoll_wait()");
    } else if (nfds == 0) {
        printf("Timeout occurred! No data within five seconds.
");
    } else {
        printf("Data is available now.
");
    }

    close(fd);
    close(epfd);
    return 0;
}
```

### Advantages over `select` and `poll`
- **Performance**: Efficient for handling large numbers of file descriptors.
- **Scalability**: Only returns the file descriptors that are ready for I/O, reducing the need to scan all descriptors.

## Summary
- **select**: Simple and portable, but limited and less efficient for large numbers of file descriptors.
- **poll**: More flexible and scalable than `select`, but can still be inefficient for large numbers of file descriptors.
- **epoll**: Efficient and scalable, ideal for high-performance applications with many file descriptors, but specific to Linux.
